Make tweets appear on web page that follow a hashtag

Check to see how I can obtain a code to use twitter api
Find technology to track twitter hashtags
Figure out database
	Preferred to search for passed tweets then start streaming new ones
	Maybe do a fetch of passed tweets then immediately after start stream while connection is alive
		What if stream is disconnected?
		Upon reconnect or refresh start the process again?
			How do you check which one was last shown/already shown?
		What happens if stream is empty?
			Replay old fetched tweets?
		What if Twitter stream finds a new tweet while it is displaying the old tweets?
			Queue up new tweet then go back to restreaming?
			How to keep track of last tweet shown of the last "replay?"
				An array id?
					Variable can keep track of which index was last shown.


- User can create an account with a username and password -- Done

- User can sign in -- Done
	- User can "link" their twitter account to their profile -- Done
	- User can "unlink" their twitter account to their profile -- Done
	- User can create an eventWall
		- User sets a tag that people type in to bring it in to the feed
			- Picture
				- Caption
			- Write a message if they dont have a twitter account
		- User sees a screen that goes through "feed"
			- User can press a key that goes through feed forward
			- User can press a key that goes through feed backward
			- User can press a key that pauses the feed
			- User can press a key that deletes that submission
				- How can the submission stay deleted if you get tweets
	- User can review/edit eventWall

- "Poster" can go to a url and post to a tag
	- Do they have to have a twitter account?
		- Would that cause people to not participate?
		- What if they don't have a twitter account?
	- What about gmail?
		- More people have a gmail account
		- Adds another layer to keep someone accountable
		- Would that be asking for too much to have people participate
	- Post goes into database with googleId
	- If a post gets deleted add a "strike" to that poster
		- 3 strikes and that person can't post anymore




take tweets, run them against "seen posts" and "seen tweets" and it shows if it hasn't been seen yet

How do you reset all posts seen?

What if you just keep track of the last seen one?

Take all tweets searched, listen for a stream, add them in current tweets, get posts made by gmailers every minute?

How can gmailers posts be added in instantaneously?


banned tweets should get pushed in its entirety for context for when a user wants to unban it. And then check its Id in the function.

// in backend eventWall feed controller?
function bannedTweetCheck() {
	// filter out banned tweets upon checking incoming get tweets
}

function timer() {
	// after a 3 seconds, call nextPost?
}

function banPost() {
	//call nextPost

	//checks to see if current post is a tweet or a gmail post

	// if gmail post
		// remove from posts array in eventWall schema
	// if tweet
		//adds current post to ban list
}
