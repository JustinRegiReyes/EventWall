Make tweets appear on web page that follow a hashtag

Check to see how I can obtain a code to use twitter api
Find technology to track twitter hashtags
Figure out database
	Preferred to search for passed tweets then start streaming new ones
	Maybe do a fetch of passed tweets then immediately after start stream while connection is alive
		What if stream is disconnected?
		Upon reconnect or refresh start the process again?
			How do you check which one was last shown/already shown?
		What happens if stream is empty?
			Replay old fetched tweets?
		What if Twitter stream finds a new tweet while it is displaying the old tweets?
			Queue up new tweet then go back to restreaming?
			How to keep track of last tweet shown of the last "replay?"
				An array id?
					Variable can keep track of which index was last shown.
