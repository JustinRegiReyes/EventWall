Make tweets appear on web page that follow a hashtag

Check to see how I can obtain a code to use twitter api
Find technology to track twitter hashtags
Figure out database
	Preferred to search for passed tweets then start streaming new ones
	Maybe do a fetch of passed tweets then immediately after start stream while connection is alive
		What if stream is disconnected?
		Upon reconnect or refresh start the process again?
			How do you check which one was last shown/already shown?
		What happens if stream is empty?
			Replay old fetched tweets?
		What if Twitter stream finds a new tweet while it is displaying the old tweets?
			Queue up new tweet then go back to restreaming?
			How to keep track of last tweet shown of the last "replay?"
				An array id?
					Variable can keep track of which index was last shown.


- User can create an account with a username and password -- Done

	- User can "unlink" their twitter account to their profile -- Done

		- User sets a tag that people type in to bring it in to the feed
			- Picture
				- Caption
			- Write a message if they dont have a twitter account
		- User sees a screen that goes through "media feed"
			- User can press a key that goes through feed forward
			- User can press a key that goes through feed backward
			- User can press a key that pauses the feed
			- User can press a key that deletes that submission
				- How can the submission stay deleted if you get tweets
	- User can review/edit "media feed"
- "Poster" can go to a url and post to a tag
	- Do they have to have a twitter account?
		- Would that cause people to not participate?
		- What if they don't have a twitter account?
	- What about gmail?
		- More people have a gmail account
		- Adds another layer to keep someone accountable
		- Would that be asking for too much to have people participate
	- Post goes into database with googleId
	- If a post gets deleted add a "strike" to that poster
		- 3 strikes and that person can't post anymore
